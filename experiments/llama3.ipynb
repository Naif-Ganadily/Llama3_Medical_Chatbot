Important immune-mediated adverse r eactions listed under WARNINGS \\nAND PRECAUTIONS may not include all possible severe and fatal i mmune-mediated adverse reactions. \\nImmune-mediated adverse reactions , which may be severe or fatal , can occur in any organ system or \\ntissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously.  Immune-mediated adverse reactions \\ncan occur at any time after star ting treatment with a PD-1/PD-L 1 blocking antibody. While immune-\\nmediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment wi th PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, \\nimmune-mediated adverse reactio ns can also manifest after disco ntinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking \\nantibodies. \\nEarly identification and managemen t of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe \\nuse of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antib odies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be \\nclinical manifestations of under lying immune-mediated adverse r eactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, \\ncreatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically d uring treatment. In cases of suspected \\nimmune-mediated adverse reactio ns, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, \\nincluding infection. Institute medical management promptly, inc luding specialty consultation as \\nappropriate. \\nWithhold or permanently  discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on sever ity [see Dosage and Administration \\n(2.3)] . In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuat ion, administer systemic \\ncorticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 m g/kg/day prednisone or equivale nt) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. \\nUpon improvement to Grade 1 or l ess, initiate corticosteroid ta per and continue to taper over at least \\n1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppre ssants in patients whose immune-\\nmediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticostero id therapy. \\nToxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do no t necessarily require systemic steroids \\n(e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discuss ed below. \\nImmune-Mediated Pneumonitis \\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediat ed pneumonitis. The incidence o f pneumonitis is higher in patients \\nwho have received prior thorac ic radiation. Immune-mediated pne umonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of \\npatients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0 .3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 \\n(1.3%) adverse reactions. System ic corticosteroids were require d in 67% (63/94) of patients with \\npneumonitis. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) of patients and \\nwithholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.9% (26) of patients.

Pneumonitis resolved in 59% \\nof the 94 patients. \\nIn clinical studies enrolling 389 adult patients with cHL who r eceived KEYTRUDA as a single agent, \\npneumonitis occurred in 31 (8%) patients, including Grades 3-4 pneumonitis in 2.3% of patients. Patients \\nreceived high-dose corticosteroi ds for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). \\nPneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to \\ndiscontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 21 (5.4%) patients. Of the patie nts who developed pneumonitis, 42% \\ninterrupted KEYTRUDA, 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA, and 77% had re solution. \\nImmune-Mediated Colitis \\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus \\n(CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated \\ncolitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, conside r repeating infectious workup to exclude \\nalternative etiologies. Immune-m ediated colitis occurred in 1.7 % (48/2799) of patients receiving \\nKEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1 .1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. \\nSystemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48) of patien ts with colitis. Additional \\nimmunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Col itis led to permanent discontinuation of \\nKEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) of pati ents and withholding of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (13) of pati ents. All patients \\nwho were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvemen t; of these, 23% had recurrence of \\ncolitis. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. \\nHepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent \\nKEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated h epatitis occurred in 0.7% \\n(19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 \\n(0.1%) adverse reactions. System ic corticosteroids were require d in 68% (13/19) of patients with \\nhepatitis. Eleven perc ent of these patients required additional immunosuppressant therapy. Hepatitis led \\nto permanent discontinuation o f KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) of patient s and withholding of KEYTRUDA in \\n0.3% (9) of patients. All patient s who were withheld reinitiate d KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; \\nof these, none had recurrence of hepatitis. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. KEYTRUDA with Axitinib \\nKEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicit y with higher than expected frequencies \\nof Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST e levations compared to KEYTRUDA a lone. Monitor liver enzymes before \\ninitiation of and periodically  throughout treatment. Consider m ore frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as \\ncompared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. F or elevated liver enzymes, interrupt \\nKEYTRUDA and axitinib, and consider  administering corticosteroi ds as needed [see Dosage and \\nAdministration (2.3)] . \\nWith the combination of KEYTRUDA  and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 i ncreased ALT (20%) and increased \\nAST (13%) were seen. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with in creased ALT received systemic \\ncorticosteroids. In patients with  ALT ≥3 times ULN (Grades 2-4,  n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in \\n94%. Among the 92 patients who we re rechallenged with either KE YTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) \\nadministered as a single agent o r with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in \\n1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA, 16 patients receiving axitinib, a nd 24 patients receiving both KEYTRUDA \\nand axitinib. All patients with a r ecurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subs equently recovered from the event. \\nImmune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency \\nKEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal \\ninsufficiency, initiate symptoma tic treatment, including hormon e replacement as clinically indicated. \\nWithhold KEYTRUDA dep ending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. \\nAdrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients re ceiving KEYTRUDA, including Grade 4 \\n(<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions .

Sev ere or fatal cases have been re ported for some of these adverse \\nreactions. \\nCardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis \\nNervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myastheni c syndrome/myasthenia \\ngravis (including exacerbation), G uillain-Barré syndrome, nerve  paresis, autoimmune neuropathy \\nOcular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can oc cur. Some cases can be associated \\nwith retinal detachment. Various  grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis \\noccurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reacti ons, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-\\nlike syndrome, as this may require  treatment with systemic ster oids to reduce the risk of permanent vision \\nloss. \\nGastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increase s in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis, \\nduodenitis \\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rha bdomyolysis (and associated \\nsequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalg ia rheumatica \\nEndocrine: Hypoparathyroidism \\nHematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia , hemophagocytic lymphohistioc ytosis, systemic \\ninflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphad enitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), \\nsarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ trans plant rejection \\n5.2 Infusion-Related Reactions\\n\\t\\nKEYTRUDA can cause severe or lif e-threatening in fusion-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and \\nanaphylaxis, which have been re ported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA .

Treatmen t of patients with multiple mye loma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking \\nantibody in combination with a  thalidomide analogue plus dexame thasone is not recommended outside of \\ncontrolled trials.  \\n5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity \\nBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm  when administered to a pregnant \\nwoman. Animal models link the PD -1/PD-L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through \\ninduction of maternal immune to lerance to fetal tissue. Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus. \\nAdvise females of reproductive potential to use effective contr aception during treatment with KEYTRUDA \\nand for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]. \\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS \\nThe following clinically signific ant adverse reactions are desc ribed elsewhere in the labeling. \\n\\uf0b7 Severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . \\n\\uf0b7 Infusion-related reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. \\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience \\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying cond itions, adverse reaction  rates observed in \\nthe clinical trials of a drug can not be directly compared to ra tes in the clinical trials of another drug and \\nmay not reflect the rates observed in practice. \\nThe data described in the WARNIN GS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect expo sure to KEYTRUDA as a single \\nagent in 2799 patients in three randomized, open-label, active-controlled trials (KEYNOTE-002, \\nKEYNOTE-006, and KEYNOTE-010), which enrolled 912 patients with  melanoma and 682 patients with \\nNSCLC, and one single-arm trial ( KEYNOTE-001), which enrolled 6 55 patients with melanoma and \\n550 patients with NSCLC. In addition to the 2799 patients, certain subsections in the WARNINGS AND \\nPRECAUTIONS describe adverse react ions observed with exposure t o KEYTRUDA as a single agent in \\na non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort trial (KEYNOTE-012),  a non-randomized, open-label, single-\\ncohort trial (KEYNOTE-055), and two randomized, open-label, act ive-controlled trials (KEYNOTE-040 and \\nKEYNOTE-048 single agen t arms), which enrolle d 909 patients wit h HNSCC; in two non-randomized, \\nopen-label trials (KEYNOT E-013 and KEYNOTE-087) and one randomized, open-label, active-controlled \\ntrial (KEYNOTE-204), w hich enrolled 389 patients with cHL; in a  randomized, open-label, active-\\ncontrolled trial (KEYNOTE-048 comb ination arm), which enrolled 276 patients with HNSCC; in \\ncombination with axitinib in a randomized, active-controlled tr ial (KEYNOTE 426), w hich enrolled 429 \\npatients with RCC; and in post-ma rketing use.

The detection of antibody \\nformation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificit y of the assay. Additionally, the observed \\nincidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positiv ity in an assay may be influenced by several \\nfactors, including assay met hodology, sample handling, timing o f sample collection, concomitant \\nmedications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, compari son of incidence of antibodies to \\npembrolizumab in the studies desc ribed below with the incidence s of antibodies in other studies or to \\nother products may be misleading. \\nTrough levels of pembrolizumab in terfere with the electrochemil uminescent (ECL) assay results; \\ntherefore, a subset analysis was performed in the patients with a concentration of pembrolizumab below \\nthe drug tolerance level of the anti-product antibody assay. In  clinical studies in patients treated with \\npembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 200 mg every 3 weeks, or 10 mg/kg every 2 or \\n3 weeks, 27 (2.1%) of 1289 evaluable patients tested positive f or treatment-emergent anti-pembrolizumab \\nantibodies of whom six (0.5%) patients had neutralizing antibodies against pembrolizumab. There was no \\nevidence of an altered pharmaco kinetic profile or increased inf usion reactions with anti-pembrolizumab \\nbinding antibody development. \\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy \\nRisk Summary \\nBased on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm  when administered to a pregnant \\nwoman. There are no available hum an data informing the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity. In animal models, \\nthe PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway  is important in the maintenance of pregnancy through induction of \\nmaternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue (see Data) . Human IgG4 (immunoglobulins) are known to cross \\nthe placenta; therefore, pembrol izumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the \\ndeveloping fetus. Advise pregnan t women of the potential risk t o a fetus. \\nIn the U.S. general population, t he estimated ba ckground risk o f major birth defects and miscarriage in \\nclinically recognized pregnancie s is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectiv ely. \\n52 \\nReference ID: 4766009 ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ganad\\\\Desktop\\\\Github Learning Freecodecamp\\\\Llama3_Medical_Chatbot\\\\documents\\\\125514s096lbl.pdf', 'page': 51}),\n",

A literature-based assessme nt of the effects of the PD-1 pathway on \\nreproduction demonstrated tha t a central function of the PD-1/P D-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy \\nby maintaining maternal immune  tolerance to the fetus. Blockade  of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in \\nmurine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; \\ntherefore, potential risks of adm inistering KEYTRUDA during pre gnancy include increased rates of \\nabortion or stillbirth. As report ed in the literature, there were no malformations rela ted to the blockade of \\nPD-1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune-mediated disorder s occurred in PD-1 \\nknockout mice. Based on its mec hanism of action, fetal exposure  to pembrolizumab may increase the risk \\nof developing immune-mediated diso rders or of altering the norm al immune response. \\n8.2 Lactation \\nRisk Summary \\nThere are no data on the presen ce of pembrolizumab in either an imal or human milk or its effects on the \\nbreastfed child or on milk pr oduction.

Pembrolizumab is a \\nhumanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody with an approximate mo lecular weight of 149 kDa. \\nPembrolizumab is produced in rec ombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. \\nKEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) injection is a sterile, preservative-f ree, clear to slightly  opalescent, colorless \\nto slightly yellow solution for intravenous use. Each vial cont ains 100 mg of pembrolizumab in 4 mL of \\nsolution. Each 1 mL of solution contains 25 mg of pembrolizumab and is formulated in: L-histidine \\n(1.55 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.2  mg), sucrose (70 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. \\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \\n12.1 Mechanism of Action \\nBinding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 recep tor found on T cells, inhibits T cell \\nproliferation and cytokine produ ction. Upregulation of PD-1 lig ands occurs in some tumors and signaling \\nthrough this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-c ell immune surveillance of tumors. \\nPembrolizumab is a monoclonal ant ibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with \\nPD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the \\nanti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, bl ocking PD-1 activity resulted in \\ndecreased tumor growth. \\n12.2 Pharmacodynamics \\nBased on the modeling of dose/ex posure efficacy and safety rela tionships and observed pharmacokinetic \\ndata from an interim analysis of 41 patients with melanoma trea ted with pembrolizumab 400 mg every \\n6 weeks, there are no anticipated clinically significant differ ences in efficacy and safety between \\npembrolizumab doses of 200 mg or 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 400 m g every 6 weeks.  \\n12.3 Pharmacokinetics \\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of pem brolizumab was characterized us ing a population PK analysis with \\nconcentration data collected from 2993 patients with various ca ncers who received pembrolizumab doses \\nof 1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 2  to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or  200 mg every 3 weeks.  \\nSteady-state concentrations of pembrolizumab were reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with an \\nevery 3-week regimen and the systemic accumulation was 2.1-fold . The peak concentration (C max), trough \\nconcentration (C min), and area under the plasma conc entration versus time curve at  steady state (AUC ss) \\nof pembrolizumab increased dose proportionally in the dose rang e of 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  \\nDistribution \\nThe geometric mean value (CV%) fo r volume of distribution at st eady state is 6.0 L (20%). \\nElimination \\nPembrolizumab clearance (CV%) is approximately 23% lower [geome tric mean, 195 mL/day (40%)] at \\nsteady state than that after the  first dose [252 mL/day (37%)];  this decrease in clearance with time is not \\nconsidered clinically import ant. The terminal half-life (t 1/2) is 22 days (32%). \\n54\\n\\t\\nReference ID: 4766009 ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ganad\\\\Desktop\\\\Github Learning Freecodecamp\\\\Llama3_Medical_Chatbot\\\\documents\\\\125514s096lbl.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=' \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Specific Populations \\nThe following factors had no clinic ally important effect on the  CL of pembrolizumab: age (range: 15 to \\n94 years), sex, race (89% White) , renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), mild hepatic impairment \\n(total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST > ULN or  total bilirubin between 1 and 1.5 times \\nULN and any AST), or tumor burden. The impact of moderate or se vere hepatic impairment on the \\npharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab is unknown.  \\nPediatric Patients:  Pembrolizumab concentrations wi th weight-based dosing at 2 mg/ kg every 3 weeks in \\npediatric patients (10 months to 17 years) are comparable to th ose of adults at the same dose. \\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility \\nNo studies have been performed  to test the potential of pembrolizumab for carcinogenicity or \\ngenotoxicity. \\nFertility studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab. I n 1-month and 6-month repeat-dose \\ntoxicology studies in monkeys , there were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs; \\nhowever, most animals in these st udies were not sexually mature . \\n13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology \\nIn animal models, inhibition of PD-1 signaling resulted in an increased severity of some infections and \\nenhanced inflammatory responses. M. tuberculo sis-infected PD-1 knockout mice exhibit markedly \\ndecreased survival compared with wild-type controls, which corr elated with increased bacterial \\nproliferation and inflammatory r esponses in these animals. PD-1  knockout mice have also shown \\ndecreased survival following infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Administration of \\npembrolizumab in chimpanzees wit h naturally occurring chronic h epatitis B infection resulted in two out of \\nfour animals with significantly increased levels of serum ALT, AST, and GGT, which persisted for at least \\n1 month after discontinuation of pembrolizumab. \\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES \\n14.1 Melanoma \\nIpilimumab-Naive Melanoma \\nThe efficacy of KEYTRUDA was in vestigated in KEYNOTE-006 (NCT01866319), a randomized (1:1:1), \\nopen-label, multicenter, active-controlled trial in 834 patient s. Patients were randomized to receive \\nKEYTRUDA at a dose of 10 mg/kg in travenously every 2 weeks or 1 0 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks \\nuntil disease progress ion or unacceptable toxicity or to ipilim umab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks \\nfor 4 doses unless discontinued earlier for disease progression  or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with \\ndisease progression could receive additional doses of treatment  unless disease progression was \\nsymptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervent ion, occurred with a decline in \\nperformance status, or was confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging. Randomization was stratified \\nby line of therapy (0 vs. 1), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), and PD-L1 expr ession (≥1% of tumor cells [positive] vs. \\n<1% of tumor cells [negative]) ac cording to an in vestigational use only (IUO) assay. Key eligibility criteria \\nwere unresectable or  metastatic melanoma; no prior ipilimumab; and no more than one prior systemic \\ntreatment for metastatic melanoma . Patients with BRAF V600E mut ation-positive melanoma were not \\nrequired to have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. Patient s with autoimmune disease; a medical \\ncondition that required immunosuppression; previous severe hype rsensitivity to other monoclonal \\nantibodies; and HIV, hepatitis B o r hepatitis C infection, were  ineligible. Assessmen t of tumor status was \\nperformed at 12 weeks , then every 6 weeks  through Week 48, foll owed by every 12 weeks thereafter. \\nThe major efficacy outcome measur es were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS; as \\nassessed by blinded independent c entral review [BICR] using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid \\nTumors [RECIST v1.1, modified to  follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target \\nlesions per organ]). Additional e fficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and \\nduration of response (DoR). \\n55\\n\\t\\nReference ID: 4766009 ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\ganad\\\\Desktop\\\\Github Learning Freecodecamp\\\\Llama3_Medical_Chatbot\\\\documents\\\\125514s096lbl.pdf', 'page': 54}),\n",
